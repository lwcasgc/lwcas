this was one of my favorite songs for a long time. i was devastated to find out the band has ended.

this song is one of the first i listened to when discovering metalcore, and it stood out with its many different melodies that are all very good, and the drumming that's quite intense yet fun to listen to and practice. i'm not quick enough to play it yet, but it'd be a dream to be able to play it perfectly.
