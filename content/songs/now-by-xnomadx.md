yet another song by this band that is among my favorites, it has the same euphoric drumming that acéphale has, but its most beautiful part at 2:00 feels way more iconic to me.

i wonder if some people never got to experience how marvelous that part is simply because they weren't interested in what leads up to it, and that also makes me wonder how many beautiful parts of songs i never listened to because i skipped them too early.
