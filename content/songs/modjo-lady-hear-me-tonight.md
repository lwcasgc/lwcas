ironically, i remember listening to this music very often days after breaking up with my last girlfriend. 

i'd go home from college riding my bike and wondering what i did wrong. 

i feel like it's supposed to be a love song, but to me it has always been somewhat melancholic through it's melody and the context i've created for it.
