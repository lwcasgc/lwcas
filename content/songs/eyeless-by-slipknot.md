i wasn't much of a rock/metal fan when i was young. i grew up in a somewhat religious family where anything that deviated from friendly and soothing songs was considered demonic and not to be appreciated. 

now that i'm grown and living my own life, i've taken the time to listen to music i never explored before. this band stood out to me first because of the masks, but the songs on their first album were exactly what i needed at that moment in my life. 

they provided a way to channel stress and express hatred towards people who actually deserve it, instead of the "always forgive everything" mentality i experienced growing up. 

i now think that feeling hatred or disliking someone isn't objectively wrong. of course, it's not about having unjustified hate for everyone, it's just that sometimes you can allow yourself to dislike people and/or their actions.
