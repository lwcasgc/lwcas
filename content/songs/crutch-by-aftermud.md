as i explored metal music and discovered what i liked about it, i found out about this band from my city. i checked out their first work, an ep that included this song, and i instantly enjoyed it. it might be hard to understand the lyrics, but i got used to them. 

this was the first song i wanted to learn on drums, and i actually did learn it. to me, it's symbolic that with enough practice, i can learn any song. i also really enjoy the main riff. 

i saw them live earlier this year, and they were all very chill, it was a great time. i'm not interested in going to these types of venues anymore, but it was an interesting experience for sure.
