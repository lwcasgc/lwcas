      <description>&lt;p&gt;this was one of my favorite songs for a long time. i was devastated to find out the band has ended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this song is one of the first i listened to when discovering metalcore, and it stood out with its many different melodies that are all very good, and the drumming that&amp;rsquo;s quite intense yet fun to listen to and practice. i&amp;rsquo;m not quick enough to play it yet, but it&amp;rsquo;d be a dream to be able to play it perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>this song is one of the first i listened to when discovering metalcore, and it stood out with its many different melodies that are all very good, and the drumming that&rsquo;s quite intense yet fun to listen to and practice. i&rsquo;m not quick enough to play it yet, but it&rsquo;d be a dream to be able to play it perfectly.</p>
<p>when i listened to it for the first time, i remember being in ecstasy with the 2:55 part because of how the tension kept increasing. i didn&rsquo;t know what to expect after that much tension, then i got surprised with a beautiful and soothing part at 3:38 that&rsquo;s engraved in my brain and will be for a long time. definitely an unforgettable song.</p>
