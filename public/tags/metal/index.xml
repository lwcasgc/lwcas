      <description>&lt;p&gt;i wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of a rock/metal fan when i was young. i grew up in a somewhat religious family where anything that deviated from friendly and soothing songs was considered demonic and not to be appreciated. now that i&amp;rsquo;m grown and living my own life, i&amp;rsquo;ve taken the time to listen to music i never explored before. this band stood out to me first because of the masks, but the songs on their first album were exactly what i needed at that moment in my life. they provided a way to channel stress and express hatred towards people who actually deserve it, instead of the &amp;ldquo;always forgive everything&amp;rdquo; mentality i experienced growing up. i now think that feeling hatred or disliking someone isn&amp;rsquo;t objectively wrong; in fact, i feel it&amp;rsquo;s unhealthy to think otherwise. of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not about having unjustified hate for everyone—it&amp;rsquo;s just that sometimes you can allow yourself to dislike people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
