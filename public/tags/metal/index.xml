      <description>&lt;p&gt;i wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of a rock/metal fan when i was young. i grew up in a somewhat religious family where anything that deviated from friendly and soothing songs was considered demonic and not to be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;now that i&amp;rsquo;m grown and living my own life, i&amp;rsquo;ve taken the time to listen to music i never explored before. this band stood out to me first because of the masks, but the songs on their first album were exactly what i needed at that moment in my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>now that i&rsquo;m grown and living my own life, i&rsquo;ve taken the time to listen to music i never explored before. this band stood out to me first because of the masks, but the songs on their first album were exactly what i needed at that moment in my life.</p>
<p>they provided a way to channel stress and express hatred towards people who actually deserve it, instead of the &ldquo;always forgive everything&rdquo; mentality i experienced growing up.</p>
<p>i now think that feeling hatred or disliking someone isn&rsquo;t objectively wrong. of course, it&rsquo;s not about having unjustified hate for everyone, it&rsquo;s just that sometimes you can allow yourself to dislike people and/or their actions.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;as i explored metal music and discovered what i liked about it, i found out about this band from my city. i checked out their first work, an ep that included this song, and i instantly enjoyed it. it might be hard to understand the lyrics, but i got used to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this was the first song i wanted to learn on drums, and i actually did learn it. to me, it&amp;rsquo;s symbolic that with enough practice, i can learn any song. i also really enjoy the main riff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>i saw them live earlier this year, and they were all very chill, it was a great time. i&rsquo;m not interested in going to these types of venues anymore, but it was an interesting experience for sure.</p>
