      <description>&lt;p&gt;i wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of a rock/metal fan when i was young. i grew up in a somewhat religious family where anything that deviated from friendly and soothing songs was considered demonic and not to be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;now that i&amp;rsquo;m grown and living my own life, i&amp;rsquo;ve taken the time to listen to music i never explored before. this band stood out to me first because of the masks, but the songs on their first album were exactly what i needed at that moment in my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>i wasn&rsquo;t much of a rock/metal fan when i was young. i grew up in a somewhat religious family where anything that deviated from friendly and soothing songs was considered demonic and not to be appreciated.</p>
<p>now that i&rsquo;m grown and living my own life, i&rsquo;ve taken the time to listen to music i never explored before. this band stood out to me first because of the masks, but the songs on their first album were exactly what i needed at that moment in my life.</p>
<p>they provided a way to channel stress and express hatred towards people who actually deserve it, instead of the &ldquo;always forgive everything&rdquo; mentality i experienced growing up.</p>
<p>i now think that feeling hatred or disliking someone isn&rsquo;t objectively wrong. of course, it&rsquo;s not about having unjustified hate for everyone, it&rsquo;s just that sometimes you can allow yourself to dislike people and/or their actions.</p>
