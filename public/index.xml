      <description>&lt;p&gt;i wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of a rock/metal fan when i was young. i grew up in a somewhat religious family where anything that deviated from friendly and soothing songs was considered demonic and not to be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;now that i&amp;rsquo;m grown and living my own life, i&amp;rsquo;ve taken the time to listen to music i never explored before. this band stood out to me first because of the masks, but the songs on their first album were exactly what i needed at that moment in my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>now that i&rsquo;m grown and living my own life, i&rsquo;ve taken the time to listen to music i never explored before. this band stood out to me first because of the masks, but the songs on their first album were exactly what i needed at that moment in my life.</p>
<p>they provided a way to channel stress and express hatred towards people who actually deserve it, instead of the &ldquo;always forgive everything&rdquo; mentality i experienced growing up.</p>
<p>i now think that feeling hatred or disliking someone isn&rsquo;t objectively wrong. of course, it&rsquo;s not about having unjustified hate for everyone, it&rsquo;s just that sometimes you can allow yourself to dislike people and/or their actions.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;as i explored metal music and discovered what i liked about it, i found out about this band from my city. i checked out their first work, an ep that included this song, and i instantly enjoyed it. it might be hard to understand the lyrics, but i got used to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this was the first song i wanted to learn on drums, and i actually did learn it. to me, it&amp;rsquo;s symbolic that with enough practice, i can learn any song. i also really enjoy the main riff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>this was the first song i wanted to learn on drums, and i actually did learn it. to me, it&rsquo;s symbolic that with enough practice, i can learn any song. i also really enjoy the main riff.</p>
<p>i saw them live earlier this year, and they were all very chill, it was a great time. i&rsquo;m not interested in going to these types of venues anymore, but it was an interesting experience for sure.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;this was one of my favorite songs for a long time. i was devastated to find out the band has ended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this song is one of the first i listened to when discovering metalcore, and it stood out with its many different melodies that are all very good, and the drumming that&amp;rsquo;s quite intense yet fun to listen to and practice. i&amp;rsquo;m not quick enough to play it yet, but it&amp;rsquo;d be a dream to be able to play it perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>when i listened to it for the first time, i remember being in ecstasy with the 2:55 part because of how the tension kept increasing. i didn&rsquo;t know what to expect after that much tension, then i got surprised with a beautiful and soothing part at 3:38 that&rsquo;s engraved in my brain and will be for a long time. definitely an unforgettable song.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="what-are-packets-in-multiplayer-games">what are packets in multiplayer games?</h1>
<p>in multiplayer games, packets are like the envelopes or messages that carry information between players&rsquo; devices and the game server. they ensure that actions like moving your character, shooting, or chatting are synchronized across all players in real-time. without packets, online gaming would be impossible—everyone would be playing in their own isolated world.</p>
<p>imagine you&rsquo;re playing a team-based game with friends:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>server:</strong> the central hub that knows everything happening in the game world.</li>
<li><strong>clients:</strong> each player&rsquo;s device, sending updates to the server and receiving updates from others.</li>
<li><strong>packets:</strong> the data bundles that travel over the internet, containing things like &ldquo;player x moved to position (10, 20)&rdquo; or &ldquo;player y fired a bullet.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>packets make sure everyone sees the same game state, even with network delays or losses. but if packets get lost or arrive out of order, it can cause glitches like rubber-banding or desyncs.</p>
<h2 id="how-packets-work-in-practice">how packets work in practice</h2>
<p>packets are sent using network protocols, mainly tcp and udp:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>tcp (transmission control protocol):</strong> reliable but slower. it guarantees packets arrive in order and retransmits lost ones. used for important data like login info or inventory changes.</li>
<li><strong>udp (user datagram protocol):</strong> fast but unreliable. packets might get lost, but no waiting for retransmission. used for real-time actions like movement updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>in games, a mix is often used. for example, movement might use udp for speed, while chat messages use tcp for reliability.</p>
<p>simple packet example (conceptual, not actual code):</p>

<p>poor packet management can ruin the experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>latency (ping):</strong> time for a packet to go to the server and back. high latency causes delays in actions.</li>
<li><strong>packet loss:</strong> some packets don&rsquo;t arrive. games interpolate missing data to smooth it out.</li>
<li><strong>jitter:</strong> inconsistent delays. causes stuttering.</li>
<li><strong>security:</strong> packets can be spoofed or tampered with, so games use encryption and validation.</li>
</ul>
<p>these issues are why games have &ldquo;netcode&rdquo; – the system handling network communication. good netcode predicts movements and corrects errors to keep the game fair and fun.</p>
<h2 id="extras">extras</h2>
<p><strong>dead reckoning:</strong> predicting player positions based on last known data to hide latency. like assuming a car keeps moving straight until new info arrives.</p>
<p><strong>rollback netcode:</strong> rewinding time to correct mistakes from lost packets, used in fighting games for precise timing.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="what-is-borrow-in-rust">what is &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; in rust?</h1>
<p>borrow in rust is a way to use a value without taking ownership of it. instead of moving a value from one place to another, you can &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; it using references. this helps rust ensure memory safety without needing a garbage collector.</p>
<p>imagine you and a friend share a laptop with a draft document:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>owner:</strong> you own the laptop and the sole editable copy of the draft.</li>
<li><strong>immutable borrow (viewing):</strong> you give your friend a read-only copy or open the file in &ldquo;view only&rdquo; mode — multiple friends can view the draft at the same time, nobody can change it.</li>
<li><strong>mutable borrow (editing):</strong> you hand the laptop to one friend or grant exclusive edit access — that friend can modify the draft, but while they have edit access you (and others) cannot edit it.</li>
<li><strong>lifetimes:</strong> the borrow lasts while the friend has the laptop or edit session; when they finish and return it, you regain full access.</li>
</ul>
<p>the result: many memory errors are caught before the program runs, so code is safer without needing a garbage collector.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works-in-practice">how it works in practice</h2>
<ul>
<li>immutable borrow (reading): you borrow only to read. in rust this is <code>&amp;</code>.</li>
<li>mutable borrow (changing): you borrow to modify. in rust this is <code>&amp;mut</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>immutable borrow:</p>

<p>these rules prevent common mistakes like using something that was already removed or modifying something at the same time (which can cause unexpected behavior). they help rust guarantee <strong>memory safety</strong> at compile time.</p>
<p><strong>memory safety</strong> means a program can&rsquo;t read or write memory it shouldn&rsquo;t. this prevents common bugs like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>use-after-free</strong>: reading data after it was dropped</p>
<ul>
<li>can cause undefined behavior: crashes, corrupted memory, or wrong values</li>
<li>security risk: may allow attackers to execute code or disclose sensitive data</li>
<li>typically timing-dependent and hard to reproduce, making bugs elusive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>double-free</strong>: freeing the same memory twice</p>
<ul>
<li>leads to heap/allocator corruption and undefined behavior, often crashing the program</li>
<li>can corrupt allocator metadata so future allocations return invalid pointers</li>
<li>a common vector for exploitation (control-flow hijack or arbitrary code execution)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>data races</strong>: two threads changing the same data at once</p>
<ul>
<li>causes nondeterministic behavior, lost updates, and inconsistent reads (corrupted state)
<ul>
<li>can produce crashes, deadlocks, or subtle logic errors that are hard to reproduce</li>
<li>may break program invariants and create security issues when sensitive data is involved</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="extras">extras</h2>
<p>garbage collector: a garbage collector (gc) is a runtime component that automatically detects and reclaims memory a program no longer uses, so developers don&rsquo;t have to manually free memory. this simplifies development but adds runtime overhead, potential pause times, and less predictable performance. rust instead provides deterministic, compile-time memory safety via ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, dropping values at well-defined points without a gc.</p>
